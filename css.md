# css

css allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial    typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface. CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.


Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface. rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

## colors 

Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.


 There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
 * RGB values
 * hex codes
 * color names


 Color pickers can help you find the color you want. It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content). CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA. X CSS3 also allows you specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
