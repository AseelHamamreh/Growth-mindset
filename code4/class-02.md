The packages are the same as directorires.

the correct order for statements in a java file: 
1. pachage.

3. class.

we have three options for using import and each option does something defferent.
there are many packages we can use with java.


### Different types of loops in Java:

loops in java: 
1. for loop (we loop a specific number of times).
2. for-each loop.
3. while loop (loop whenever the condition is true).
4. do-while loop (do the statement at least one time and then do it whenever the **while condition** is true).
