## Object-Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming can be described by the following main concepts : 

1. Abstraction : 
- showing the important details to the user.
- we only care about calling the method, we don't care about the underline implementation.

2. Inheritance:
- allows code reusability.
- using data and methods from class to another.

3. Polymorphism: 
- poly: many / morphism: forms.
- allows to determine which function to run while the program is running.

4. Encapsulation:
- we can make things public and private.
- we can get and set.
