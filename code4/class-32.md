# Read: 32 - Serverless and Amplify

## serverless 

* serverless doesn't mean that there is no server; it means that the developer don't need to care about writing code, creating or maintaining the server; these stuff will be managed by a host. 
* Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.
* Serverless applications are event-driven cloud-based systems where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls (Functions as a Service).

### traditional server vs Serverless:
1. cost: Serverless is reduced cost that traditional server.
2. Networking: Serverless functions are accessed only as private APIs, means we cannot directly access them through the usual IP; so traditional server is better here.
3. 3rd Party Dependencies:  For simple applications with few dependencies, Serverless is the winner; for anything more complex, Traditional Architecture is the winner.
4. Environments: serverless is easier here and better.
5. Timeout: Traditional Architecture is better.

## GraphQL 

* The GraphQL Transform provides a simple to use abstraction that helps you quickly create backends for your web and mobile applications on AWS. With the GraphQL Transform, you define your applicationâ€™s data model using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and the library handles converting your SDL definition into a set of fully descriptive AWS CloudFormation templates that implement your data model.
