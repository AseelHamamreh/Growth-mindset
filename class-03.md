## Duckett HTML book Chapter 3 : Lists

There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:

1. **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number. 
The ordered list is created with the `<ol>` element.
Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag.

2. **Unordered** lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
The unordered list is created with the `<ul>` element.
Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag.

3. **Definition** lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
