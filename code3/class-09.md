## FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

* Pure functions benefits:
The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts.
