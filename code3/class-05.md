# Class-05 reading Summary

### building components and applications with React steps:

* Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names

* Step 2: Build A Static Version in React

to implement your app

* Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

 to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state.

* Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live

to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.

* Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow

 to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.
