### **Growth mindest** is believing that your mind ability can be improved by hardworking.

I can keep reminding myself to keep on a growth mindest by many ways some of them:
* Trying differnt learning ways.
* replacing the word ~~fail~~ by **learn**.
* not being afraid and keep trying until I get my goal.
