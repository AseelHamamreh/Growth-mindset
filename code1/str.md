# Structure web pages with HTML

 It's important to understand who your target audience 
is, why they would come to your site, what information 
they want to find and when they are likely to return. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that 
will need to go on each page. Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps 
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them. You can differentiate between pieces of information 
using size, color, and style. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify 
the information you present

HTML pages are text documents. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled 
brackets) to give the information they surround special 
meaning. Tags are often referred to as elements. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that element. Attributes require a name and a value. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they 
can go.

<div> elements are often used as containing elements 
to group together sections of a page. Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you 
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning. The float property moves content to the left or right 
of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.). Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts. Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, 
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling). Grids help create professional and flexible designs. CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

Whenever you want to collect information from 
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a 
<form> element. Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs. Each form control is given a name, and the text the 
user types in or the values of the options they select 
are sent to the server. HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
