    <h1> CSS </h1>

    <p> CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can
        specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface,
        or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface. CSS treats each HTML element as if
        it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
        element should look. </p>
    <hr>

    <p> Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
        elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
        indicate what these elements should look like).Different types of selectors allow you to target your
        rules at different elements.</p>


    <p> Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
        of the element that you want to change, and the values
        of those properties. For example, the font-family
        property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
        specifies Arial as the preferred typeface. </p>


    <p> rules usually appear in a separate document,
        although they may appear within an HTML page. </p>


    <h1> Colors
    </h1>

    <p>
     
        Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.

        There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
    <ul>
<li>RGB values</li>
<li>hex codes</li>
<li>color names.</li>
    </ul>


    </p>
    
<p>

    Color pickers can help you find the color you want. It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
    between any text and the background color (otherwise
    people will not be able to read your content). CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
    indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA. X CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
    with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
