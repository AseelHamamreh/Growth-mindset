#### Headings

HTML has six "levels" of headings:
**<h1>** is used for main headings

**<h2>** is used for subheadings

If there are further sections under the subheadings then the **<h3>** element is used, and so on...

#### Paragraphs

To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening **<p>** tag and closing **</p>** tag.
By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.

#### Bold & Italic

By enclosing words in the tags **<b>** and **</b>** we can make characters appear bold.

By enclosing words in the tags **<i>** and **</i>** we can make characters appear italic.

#### Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules

If you want to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag **<br />**.

To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the **<hr />** tag.
