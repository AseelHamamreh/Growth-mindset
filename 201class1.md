## Chapter 1 : Structure

HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages. and each element made up of two tags:
* An opening Tag.
* A closing Tag.

Any HTML code should be between HTML element : <HTML> The code is written here </HTML>

We have many elements such as **H1** (heading) and **p** (paragraph), they both can be used for text, the main difference between them is the **importance**.

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element, and they are made of two parts: A name and a value, seperated by an equal sign:


<img src="class1-1.PNG" alt="Attributes" />
 

HTML code consists of two main parts:
1. The head ; contains the title of the WebPage, the css internal stylling, and the linking sentence for other files.

2. the body; which I will write here my WebPage structure code.
