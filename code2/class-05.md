## Duckett HTML book Chapter 5 : Images

There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart.

### Adding Images

![adding img](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/adding-html-images.PNG)

To add an image into the page
you need to use an **< img >**
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
* src 
* alt

You will also often see an **< img >**
element use two other attributes
that specify its size:
### height
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.

### width
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.

### Three Rules for Creating Images:
1. Save images in the right format.
2. Save images at the right size.
3. Use the correct resolution.

## Duckett HTML book Chapter 11 : Color

### rgb values:
RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display. Red, green, and blue can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. Levels of R, G, and B can each range from 0 to 100 percent of full intensity. Each level is represented by the range of decimal numbers from 0 to 255 (256 levels for each color).

### hex codes:

Hex codes are a hexadecimal format for identifying colors. This is a system used in HTML, CSS and SVG. Each hex code refers to a very specific color, which allows for two designers or a designer and developer to be on the same page about what exact light blue (or any other color) they are referring to. They are always a six-digit code, which contains three pieces of information:

1. The first two digits provide information about the amount of Red in a color
2. The second two digits provide information about the amount of Green
3. The last two digits provide information about the amount of Blue.

### color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers.

## HSL Colors

* **hue**
Hue is the colloquial idea of
color. In HSL colors, hue is often
represented as a color circle
where the angle represents the
color, although it may also be
shown as a slider with values
from 0 to 360.

* **saturation**
Saturation is the amount of
gray in a color. Saturation is
represented as a percentage.
100% is full saturation and 0%
is a shade of gray.

## Duckett HTML book Chapter 12 : Text

* There are properties to control t XX he choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
* You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.

## JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

* Use **JPEG** format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth.

* Use **PNG** format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos.

* Use **GIF** format for images that contain animations.
