## Duckett JavaScript book Chapter 3 : Object Literals

### WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.
* VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES.
* FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS.

Like variables and named functions,
properties and methods have a
name and a va lue. In an object,
that name is called a key.
An object cannot have two keys
with the same name. This is
because keys are used to access
their corresponding values. 
The value of a property can be a
st ring, number, Boolean, array, or
even another object. The va lue of a
method is always a function.

## Duckett JavaScript book Chapter 5 : Document Object Model

### THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE

As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.
The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.
It consists of four main types of nodes.

![dom tree](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z0QnE9eWAnM/XWj6B0TmfmI/AAAAAAAAZps/aRfAU517hg0ovfzgLUTZkmjHD3SXZCoWACLcBGAs/s640/DOM.PNG)

1. THE DOCUMENT NODE.
2. ELEMENT NODES.
3. ATTRIBUTE NODES.
4. TEXT NODES.

### WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE

Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.
