## Duckett JavaScript book Chapter 3 : Object Literals

### WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.
* VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES.
* FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS.

Like variables and named functions,
properties and methods have a
name and a va lue. In an object,
that name is called a key.

An object cannot have two keys
with the same name. This is
because keys are used to access
their corresponding values. 

The value of a property can be a
st ring, number, Boolean, array, or
even another object. The va lue of a
method is always a function.
