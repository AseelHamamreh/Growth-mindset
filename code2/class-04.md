## Duckett HTML book Chapter 4 : Links

Links are created using the **<a>** element. Users can click on anything
between the opening **<a>** tag and the closing **</a>** tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

`<a href="YOUR LINK HEHE">THE TEXT USER CLICK ON</a>`

## Duckett HTML book Chapter 15 : Layout

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

#### Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

CSS has the following **positioning schemes** that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

#### Screen Sizes

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.

#### Sc reen Resolution

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

#### Page Sizes

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).
